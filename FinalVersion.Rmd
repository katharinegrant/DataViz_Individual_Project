## Redesign Visualizations
### Visualization 1 - Graphs #5&6
For graphs 5 and 6, I thought that the high levels of both gun violence and gun ownership in the U.S. shown in graph 5 would be more recognizable when overlaid on graph 6 of various developed countries. From an aesthetic side, I also wanted to find a middle ground on colors, as graph #5 is glaringly bright and graph #6 has very little color.

#### Data
The original data sources for graphs 5 and 6 are either behind a paywall or outdated so I found more current versions of the same data. Graph #5 used state-level gun deaths per 100,000 people and gun ownership per 100 adults, while the [original graph #6](https://web.archive.org/web/20130608092702/http://tewksburylab.org/blog/2012/12/gun-violence-and-gun-ownership-further-refinement-and-response-to-reader-comments/) used country-level gun deaths per 100,000 people and gun ownership per 100 people filtered by country High Development Index. The firearm-related deaths and ownership by country data come from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate). The list of countries by HDI comes from the [United Nations Development Programme](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data). The state-level gun death data comes from the [Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D). The state-level gun ownership comes from [DemographicData.org](http://demographicdata.org/facts-and-figures/gun-ownership-statistics/).
I combined the datasets into one table in excel which is in the excel folder.

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “Guns per 100 people” (as a dimension) and the row as “Total Gun Deaths per 100,000 people” (as a dimension). I then filtered “2015 HDI” to at least 0.79 (same parameter as original for countries), set the point colors by type (country vs. state), changed the point shape, and added the “Place” name as text.

[why]n [Future Enhancements: A future feature could be adding trend lines, either one for the countries and one for the states or one overall trend line. Another enhancement could be merging the data with a regulation grading score or scale so that the audience can see which states have similar restrictions to other countries.]

### Visualization 2 - Graph #8
In graph 8, I wanted to better visualize the relationship between gun control laws and gun-related deaths. The original had a state-level heat-map of the gun deaths per 100,000 people with the other variable only showing if there were any firearm laws in place. I thought it would be more interesting to instead look at a scale of regulation levels.

#### Data
Both the 2017 gun death rate (per 100,000) the 2017 gun law “grade” come from the state rankings table by the Giffords Law Center (http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/). I then copied the table into excel to use as my dataset (which is in the excel folder).

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “Gun Death Rate per 100,000 people” (as a dimension) and the row as “Grade” (as a dimension). I then set the point colors by Grade (a rainbow color scale from A = blue to F = red), set the x-axis to 0-24, and added the “State” name as text.

[why]n [Future Enhancements: While the data trend is pretty clear, a future enhancement could be adding a trend line which would likely involve converting the letter grades to GPA format so that both variables are numeric.]

### Visualization 3 - Graph #10
While graph #10 shows that firearm suicides are consistently more frequent than firearm homicides over time, I thought it would be interesting to look at all the different intentions behind gun deaths and by state instead of by year.

#### Data
The data for this graph came from the National Violent Death Reporting System (https://wisqars.cdc.gov:8443/nvdrs/nvdrsDisplay.jsp) My parameters were: Age-adjusted Rates, Crude Rates and Death Counts, Use 2000 as the Standard Year; 1. Violent Death Counts and Rates; 2. All Intents; 3. All; 4. Firearm (All); 5. 2015, All Funded States, All Races, All Ethnicity, Both Sexes; All Ages; Down: State, Intent; Across: None. I then copied it into an excel sheet (which is in the excel folder).

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “State” (as a dimension) and the row as “Deaths per 100,000” (as a dimension). I then filtered by “Deaths per 100,000” to remove null values and set the bar colors by Intent and changed the color scale.

[why]n [Future Enhancements: A future enhancement could be grouping the three other intents into one “Other” category to simplify the bar graph. Another future feature would be to integrate the state gun law grades to look for a trend in gun deaths by type.]

## Deceptive Visualizations

### Visualization 1 - Graph #13
The original graph #13 only focuses on suicides and specifically only firearm suicides. My first thoughts when seeing the original graph were whether or not overall suicides had the same downward trend and if the gun buyback had any impact on gun homicides. If I could make a visualization that shows the trend in gun suicides is only a part of a larger trend, I can argue that gun ownership is not the problem.

#### Data
The data came from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' report on causes of death from 1980 to 2016 (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIbOUd6uVnecoN4POu8X1G0L86YPMNVtaqPB__6Z5AY/). Then in Excel, I created new columns to calculate the number of non-gun homicides and suicides. The file is in the excel folder (Australian_Deaths.xlsx).

#### Graph Steps

Once in Tableau, I created calculated fields for all not-gun-related deaths by adding other homicides and other suicides, and all gun-related deaths by adding gun homicides and gun suicides.

I set the columns as “Year” (as a dimension) and the rows as “Measure Values” which I filtered to only “Not Gun-Related” and “Gun-Related”. I then added a reference line for the beginning of the buyback program, changed the bar colors based on the measure names, and added text boxes with the source and an explanation.

While I did experiment with including the full breakdown of gun-related vs. not gun-related and suicide vs. homicide, the extra detail looked unnecessary since I was focusing on the trend in all deaths. I also tried the same graph with the death rates instead of counts, but the overall rate was decreasing while the overall count was increasing which is a better contradiction to claims that the buyback decreased deaths.

#### Future Enhancements
A future feature could be including trend lines for the gun-related deaths and the total deaths to highlight that despite the downward trend in gun deaths, violent deaths have not decreased.

### Visualization 2 - Graph #1
The original graph #1 made its point by limiting the data to developed countries. When compared to only similar countries, the U.S. is very obviously an outlier with regards to gun deaths. However, when I worked on the revision for graph #6, I could see that there were countries with higher rates than the U.S. that could make the U.S. look normal.

#### Data
The dataset is the same as the one I used for a previous revision and is in the excel folder (Gun death and ownership comb.xlsx). The firearm-related deaths by country data come from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate.

#### Graph Steps
I set the columns as “Country”  and the rows as “Gun Deaths per 100,000 People” before deciding to switch them to make the names more readable and sort the countries by rate. I then filtered gun deaths to above 2.5 to remove the long tail of countires with low gun deaths so the U.S. was closer to the center. I also changed the bar color for the U.S. so it would stand out and added a text box with the source. When placing the graph into a dashboard, I removed the legend because it was exactly the same as the y-axis labels.

#### Future Enhancements
A future enhancement could be including a time element to see how the countries' gun death rates have changed over the last few years or decades, although I don't know which side of the argument the time-lapsed data would support since I don't know if the U.S. has risen or fallen in its ranking.

### Visualization 3 - Graph #6
Like with graph #1, I was curious how graph #6 could be manipulated by changing the selected countries. The original graph excluded countries with low Development Index scores and I thought including those countries or removing countries with low populations might change the graph's trend.

#### Data
The data for this graph was the same as in my previous graph. However, I merged the data with another table of country populations (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)) which is in the excel folder (CountryPop.xlsx).

#### Graph Steps
At first, I set up the graph similar to the original with gun ownership as the columns and the gun deaths as the rows. I tried to cherry-pick the data based on country population because I thought removing countries with lower populations may skew the data. However, this was not the case so I moved on to my next method of deception.

I changed the graph so that the columns and rows were longitude and latitude and the countries were circles, while the gun rate was the circle size and the gun death rate was the circle color. I then changed the color scheme to red-green in four segments with green as low death rates and red as high death rates. By adjusting the color-coding to four segments, only six countries are red, making the U.S. are show as green and presumably good. I considered changing the size scale of the circles but any larger and the European countries would have started to clump together.

The change to a map was to distract from the actual trends seen in the original graph. Instead, because of the placement and size of the circles, the reader will notice that the U.S.'s circle is both big and green while all of the red circles are smaller, which supports the claim that countries with more guns have fewer gun deaths.

#### Future Enhancements

A future enhancement could be to find more data for areas other than Europe and the Americas because the visualization feels somewhat unbalanced with very few data points on the right, but I don't want to crop off nearly half of the map.
