# Individual Project - Final Visualizations
Katharine Grant

## Introduction
In the [original Vox article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts), we see 17 graphs that tell us that gun violence in the U.S. is drastically higher than in otherwise similar countries and that it is a direct result of high gun ownership rates and lax gun restrictions. The article starts off with more simple representations of data like firearm homicide rates by country and a map of all mass shootings in the last five years before moving onto visualizing correlations for both firearm homicides and firearm suicides.

## Redesign Visualizations
For the redesigns, my audience is the same as the original article, generally liberal Americans with a midlevel education and data literacy. This audience will want to believe my claims about the benefits of gun regulations and will be less skeptical of my visualizations.

### Visualization 1 - Graphs #5&6
When planning my first redesign, I though that graphs #5 and #6 could be converted to the same scale and put side by side, or overlaid with the states and countries as different colored points. Since my goal was to support the claim that more guns means more gun deaths, overlaying them would be especially striking since most other countries have fewer than four gun deaths per 100,000 people while the lowest rate for a state is three or four per 100,000 people. From an aesthetic side, I also wanted to find a middle ground on colors, as graph #5 is glaringly bright and graph #6 has very little color.

#### Data
The original data sources for graphs 5 and 6 are either behind a paywall or outdated so I found more current versions of the same data. Graph #5 used state-level gun deaths per 100,000 people and gun ownership per 100 adults, while the [original graph #6](https://web.archive.org/web/20130608092702/http://tewksburylab.org/blog/2012/12/gun-violence-and-gun-ownership-further-refinement-and-response-to-reader-comments/) used country-level gun deaths per 100,000 people and gun ownership per 100 people filtered by country High Development Index. The firearm-related deaths and ownership by country data come from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate). The list of countries by HDI comes from the [United Nations Development Programme](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data). The state-level gun death data comes from the [Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/firearms-death-rate-per-100000/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D). The state populations come from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population). In my first version, I could only find gun ownership rates by state from [DemographicData.com](http://demographicdata.org/facts-and-figures/gun-ownership-statistics/), but this time I was able to find the number of guns per state from [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/215655/number-of-registered-weapons-in-the-us-by-state/) and used that data instead, as it better matched the country-level data. The data wrangling can be found in [this file](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/Viz1.ipynb). However, when experimenting with this data, it did not fit the pattern I was trying to show and so I switched back to using the ownership data.

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “Guns per 100 people” (as a dimension) and the row as “Total Gun Deaths per 100,000 people” (as a dimension). I then filtered “2015 HDI” to at least 0.79 (same parameter as original for countries), set the point colors by type (country vs. state), changed the point shape, and added the “Place” name as text.

#### Revisions
To improve the visualization, I changed the point shape by type as well so that the graph will be as effective in black and white. However, I did leave in the color as I think it does help highlight the differences between the two categories. I also changed the graph name to "Higher gun ownership leads to more gun deaths" as it better explains my claim. I also tried adding trend lines for each type but they do not add much information and decrease the data to pixel ratio, so I left them off.

### Visualization 2 - Graph #8
When planning my first redesign of graph 8, I wanted to better visualize the relationship between gun control laws and gun-related deaths. The original had a state-level heat-map of the gun deaths per 100,000 people with the other variable only showing if there were any firearm laws in place. I thought it would be more interesting to instead look at a scale of regulation levels.

#### Data
Both the 2017 gun death rate (per 100,000) the 2017 gun law “grade” come from the state rankings table by the [Giffords Law Center](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/). I then copied the table into excel to use as my dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/State%20law%20grade%20and%20deaths.xlsx).

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “Gun Death Rate per 100,000 people” (as a dimension) and the row as “Grade” (as a dimension). I then set the point colors by Grade (a rainbow color scale from A = blue to F = red), set the x-axis to 0-24, and added the “State” name as text.

#### Revisions
To improve the visualization, I removed the rainbow coloring as it is both unnecessary and admittedly a bit of an eyesore. Since I removed the color scale, I could then remove the legend which improved the data to pixel ratio. I changed the graph's title to "Fewer Gun Deaths in States with Stricter Gun Laws" as it better conveys my claim. I also added an annotation with the source's explanation of how the letter grades are calculated so that the audience is less likely to ignore the visualization out of skepticism.

### Visualization 3 - Graph #10
When planning my first redesign of graph 10, I wanted to look at all the different intentions behind gun deaths and by state instead of by year. Since the overall argument is about gun deaths, I thought looking at mainly firearm suicides was ignoring the bigger picture.

#### Data
The data for this graph came from the [National Violent Death Reporting System](https://wisqars.cdc.gov:8443/nvdrs/nvdrsDisplay.jsp). My parameters were: Age-adjusted Rates, Crude Rates and Death Counts, Use 2000 as the Standard Year; 1. Violent Death Counts and Rates; 2. All Intents; 3. All; 4. Firearm (All); 5. 2015, All Funded States, All Races, All Ethnicity, Both Sexes; All Ages; Down: State, Intent; Across: None. I then copied it directly into [an excel sheet](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/Intent%20and%20State.xlsx).

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set the column as “State” (as a dimension) and the row as “Deaths per 100,000” (as a dimension). I then filtered by “Deaths per 100,000” to remove null values and set the bar colors by Intent and changed the color scale.

#### Revisions
To improve the visualization, I sorted the state columns by total firearm deaths in order to make size comparisons between states easier for the viewer. I also grouped all causes besides homicide and suicide into an "Other" label to declutter the columns since the other categories were all very small. I also made the color scheme a little less glaring. Unlike the other two visualizations, I did not change the title as this one is more exploratory than declarative.

## Deceptive Visualizations
For the deceptive versions, my audience is gun owners and other people who are against gun regulations, generally conservative Americans with presumably a midlevel education and data literacy. This audience will want to believe any claims that gun regulation is ineffective and will be less skeptical of these visualizations.

### Visualization 1 - Graph #13
The original graph #13 only focuses on suicides and specifically only firearm suicides. My first thoughts when seeing the original graph were whether or not overall suicides had the same downward trend and if the gun buyback had any impact on gun homicides. If I could make a visualization that shows the trend in gun suicides is only a part of a larger trend, I can argue that gun ownership is not the problem.

#### Data
The data came from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics' report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dIbOUd6uVnecoN4POu8X1G0L86YPMNVtaqPB__6Z5AY/) on causes of death from 1980 to 2016. Then in Excel, I created new columns to calculate the number of non-gun homicides and suicides. [The file](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/Australian_Deaths.xlsx) is in the excel folder.

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I created calculated fields for all not-gun-related deaths by adding other homicides and other suicides, and all gun-related deaths by adding gun homicides and gun suicides.

I set the columns as “Year” (as a dimension) and the rows as “Measure Values” which I filtered to only “Not Gun-Related” and “Gun-Related”. I then added a reference line for the beginning of the buyback program, changed the bar colors based on the measure names, and added text boxes with the source and an explanation.

While I did experiment with including the full breakdown of gun-related vs. not gun-related and suicide vs. homicide, the extra detail looked unnecessary since I was focusing on the trend in all deaths. I also tried the same graph with the death rates instead of counts, but the overall rate was decreasing while the overall count was increasing which is a better contradiction to claims that the buyback decreased deaths.

#### Revisions
To improve the visualization, I added trend lines which required changing the visualization from a bar graph to a line graph. While I had liked the look of the bar graph, I felt that showing the trend line for total violent deaths was more important to my claim that violent deaths had not decreased since the buyback. I also rephrased the axes, reference line, and legend so that they were more clear.

### Visualization 2 - Graph #1
The original graph #1 made its point by limiting the data to developed countries. When compared to only similar countries, the U.S. is very obviously an outlier with regards to gun deaths. However, when I worked on the revision for graph #6, I could see that there were countries with higher rates than the U.S. that could make the U.S. look normal.

#### Data
The dataset is the same as the one I used for a previous revision and can be found [here](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/Gun%20death%20and%20ownership%20comb.xlsx). The firearm-related deaths by country come from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate).

#### Graph Steps
I set the columns as “Country”  and the rows as “Gun Deaths per 100,000 People” before deciding to switch them to make the names more readable and sort the countries by rate. I then filtered gun deaths to above 2.5 to remove the long tail of countires with low gun deaths so the U.S. was closer to the center. I also changed the bar color for the U.S. so it would stand out and added a text box with the source. When placing the graph into a dashboard, I removed the legend because it was exactly the same as the y-axis labels.

#### Revisions
I did not revise this one because it already makes its point in a clear and concise way. The implicit claim is that the U.S.'s gun death rate is not abnormally high. While it could be made more deceptive by removing select countries or trimming more countries off of the tail, I think that any more deception would become too obvious and the reader would dismiss the entire visualization. While the chart could be changed to be black and grey instead of blue and green, they are different enough shades that they will not be confused if the graph is shown in black and white.

### Visualization 3 - Graph #6
Like with graph #1, I was curious how graph #6 could be manipulated by changing the selected countries. The original graph excluded countries with low Development Index scores and I thought including those countries or removing countries with low populations might change the graph's trend.

#### Data
The data for this graph was the same as in my previous graph. However, I merged the data with another table of country populations from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)) which is in the [excel folder](https://github.com/katharinegrant/DataViz_Individual_Project/blob/master/Excel_Sheets/CountryPop.xlsx).

#### Graph Steps
In the first version, I set up the graph similar to the original with gun ownership as the columns and the gun deaths as the rows. I tried to cherry-pick the data based on country population because I thought removing countries with lower populations may skew the data. However, this was not the case so I moved on to my next method of deception.

I changed the graph so that the columns and rows were longitude and latitude and the countries were circles, while the gun rate was the circle size and the gun death rate was the circle color. I then changed the color scheme to red-green in four segments with green as low death rates and red as high death rates. By adjusting the color-coding to four segments, only six countries are red, making the U.S. show as green and presumably good. I considered changing the size scale of the circles but any larger and the European countries would have started to clump together.

The change to a map was to distract from the actual trends seen in the original graph. Instead, because of the placement and size of the circles, the reader will notice that the U.S.'s circle is both big and green while all of the red circles are smaller, which supports the claim that countries with more guns have fewer gun deaths.

#### Revisions
To improve the visualization, I cropped the map to focus on the Americas and Europe. This had two benefits. First, it de-clumps Europe so that I can enlarge the size of the circles' scale, making each European country's gun ownership appear higher than it is. Secondly, it hides some of the smaller green circles in Asia at first glance since they contradict the visualization's claim.
